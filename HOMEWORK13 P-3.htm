    <h1>WHAT IS <abbr title="GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY">GTR</abbr>?</h1>
    <h2>The <abbr title="GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY">GTR</abbr>, proposed by Albert Einstein in 1915, is one of the cornerstones of modern physics. It fundamentally changed our understanding of gravity and the fabric of space and time.
        According to the theory:
        
        For example, <abbr title="GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM">GPS</abbr> satellites must account for relativistic effects because time runs slightly faster for them (due to weaker gravity) than it does on Earth's surface.
        It's a beautiful and mind-bending theory that continues to shape our understanding of the universe! Are you fascinated by such groundbreaking ideas?</h2>
